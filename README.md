# eveproxy

[![Build & Release](https://github.com/tonycknight/eveproxy/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tonycknight/eveproxy/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A proxy service for APIs in the Eve online space.

## What's it for?

Many of these essential 3rd party APIs tend to impose rate limiting: they are, after all, managed and paid for out of personal time & wallets. This proxy service attempts to keep 3rd party API integrations safe for the providers and transparent to users.

Some notable examples are:
- [Zkb](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard) - the grand daddy of all killboards.
- [Redisq](https://github.com/zKillboard/RedisQ) - the only live-streaming killmail service in existence.
- [Evewho](https://github.com/zKillboard/evewho) - character and corporation lookup.

These very popular APIs are unfortunately continually abused and so are often rate limited, obliging clients to be good net citizens.

## How to run & install

Coming up!
